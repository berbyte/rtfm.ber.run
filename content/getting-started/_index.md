## Summary
The BER framework leverages the Actor model to combine independent, distributed processing with the power of AI. This creates dynamic, guided, and modifiable agents—BERAgents—capable of assisting you and executing tasks within their defined domains.

[![BER's High Level System Diagram](/diagrams/ber-001-framework.svg)](/diagrams/ber-001-framework.svg)

The framework has two key components:
- BERAgents: Independent actors that perform tasks and workflows.
- BERAdapters: Communication channels that enable seamless integration with external systems like APIs, databases, and cloud services.

Together, these components enable a highly modular and parallelized system of agents and adapters, ready to tackle complex workflows.

This documentation provides an overview of the system, tutorials to help you get started, and practical examples to compose and customize BER. Start building today to see how BER can streamline your workflows.
