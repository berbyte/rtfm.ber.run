## Summary
First, look at what you get by the end of our guide. After correct setup, you see `BER` builds server- and client-side units. By launching the TUI or integrating a GitHub application you will be able to start using `BER` -- in natural language -- requesting work-, compute-, or data-resources. The next page is going to include examples and usecases then we describe how to prepare run-time environment.

( `BER` implements the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) to combine distributed processing and AI.)

The system has two key base types:
- `BERAgents`: Independent actors that perform tasks and workflows. (server-side)
- `BERAdapters`: Communication channels that enable integration with external systems. (client-side)

This documentation provides the first steps to use `BER`. You can find in other categories articles about:
 - [Concepts](/concepts) - overview of the system,
 - [Tutorials](/tutorials) - help material for learning,
 - [Guides](/guides) - practical examples to compose and customize BER.
