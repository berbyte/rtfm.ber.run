BER's flexible framework enables powerful automation and integration across different domains. Here are some key use cases:

## Domain Management

Streamline DNS and certificate management through natural language interactions. BER connects your project management tools directly to cloud services, enabling teams to handle domain operations through simple requests. This includes automated domain registration, DNS configuration, SSL certificate management, and proactive monitoring - all through your existing workflow tools.


### Example Chat

```{filename=USER}
hey @ber, create a DNS record for demo.ber.run pointing to 127.0.0.1
with a TTL of 600 seconds.
```

```{filename=BER}
New DNS Record

============================
| Hostname: | demo.ber.run |
| Target:   | 127.0.0.1    |
| Type:     | A            |
| TTL:      | 3600         |
============================

üëâ To create the record, comment: @ber approve 5bb9384d
```

```{filename=USER}
@ber Changed my mind, point the record to rtfm.ber.run and use a lower ttl.
```

```{filename=BER}
New DNS Record

============================
| Hostname: | demo.ber.run |
| Target:   | rtfm.ber.run |
| Type:     | CNAME        |
| TTL:      | 600          |
============================

üëâ To create the record, comment: @ber approve 734b095b
```

```{filename=USER}
@ber approve 734b095b
```

```{filename=BER}
‚úÖ demo.ber.run sucessfully created.

Details:
============================
| Hostname: | demo.ber.run |
| Target:   | rtfm.ber.run |
| Type:     | CNAME        |
| TTL:      | 600          |

## User Access Management

Simplify employee onboarding and offboarding across multiple SaaS services. While SSO solutions help, many organizations still struggle with managing user access across various platforms that don't support single sign-on. BER automates the tedious process of user provisioning, permission management, and access revocation across disparate systems.

```
hey @ber, create accounts for jane.doe@company.com in our standard
tools stack (Slack, Jira, GitLab) with developer permissions
```

```
hey @ber, show me all active service accounts for
john.smith@company.com who is leaving next week
```

```
hey @ber, revoke all access for departed employee
mark.wilson@company.com and generate an audit report
```


## Code Visualization

Transform code into clear, visual diagrams automatically. BER helps development teams understand and document code behavior by generating flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, and architecture visualizations. This ensures documentation stays current with the codebase and helps teams communicate technical concepts effectively.

```
hey @ber, draw a detailed flowchart of the following code: ...
```

```
hey @ber, generate a sequence diagram for this function
and highlight all API calls: ...
```

## Custom Reports

Simplify data access and analysis across your organization. BER can dynamically construct database queries, generate formatted reports, and deliver insights through your preferred channels. This eliminates manual data extraction and formatting work while ensuring consistent reporting across teams.

```
hey @ber, generate a report of all users who signed up
in the last 30 days, grouped by country
```

```
hey @ber, query the sales database and give me the
total revenue for each product category in the last quarter
```

## Incident Management

Accelerate incident response through intelligent automation. BER connects your monitoring systems, chat platforms, and ITSM tools to streamline the entire incident lifecycle. From initial detection through resolution and post-mortems, BER reduces manual coordination work and helps teams resolve issues faster.

```
hey @ber, monitor the logs for this error: ConnectionTimeout,
and create a ticket in ServiceNow if it appears again
```

These use cases demonstrate BER's ability to bridge gaps between tools and teams, enabling natural language automation of complex workflows. The framework's flexibility allows you to adapt these patterns to your organization's specific needs and processes.
