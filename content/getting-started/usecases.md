BER's flexible framework enables powerful automation and integration across different domains.

Here are some key use cases, which you can already try out.

## Domain Management

> [!TIP]
> In this example, a user manages DNS records through natural language commands:
> 1. Initially requests an A record for demo.ber.run
> 2. Changes their mind to create a CNAME record instead
> 3. Approves the change, which is then implemented

```{filename=USER}
hey @ber, create a DNS record for demo.ber.run pointing to 127.0.0.1
with a TTL of 600 seconds.
```

```{filename=BER}
New DNS Record

============================
| Hostname: | demo.ber.run |
| Target:   | 127.0.0.1    |
| Type:     | A            |
| TTL:      | 3600         |
============================

üëâ To create the record, comment: @ber approve 5bb9384d
```

```{filename=USER}
@ber Changed my mind, point the record to rtfm.ber.run and use a lower ttl.
```

```{filename=BER}
New DNS Record

============================
| Hostname: | demo.ber.run |
| Target:   | rtfm.ber.run |
| Type:     | CNAME        |
| TTL:      | 600          |
============================

üëâ To create the record, comment: @ber approve 734b095b
```

```{filename=USER}
@ber approve 734b095b
```

```{filename=BER}
‚úÖ demo.ber.run sucessfully created.

Details:
============================
| Hostname: | demo.ber.run |
| Target:   | rtfm.ber.run |
| Type:     | CNAME        |
| TTL:      | 600          |

## Code Visualization

> [!TIP]
> This example shows how BER can automatically generate diagrams from code:
> 1. User requests a sequence diagram for authentication flow
> 2. BER analyzes the code and generates a Mermaid diagram
> 3. User approves and the diagram is saved as SVG

```{filename=USER}
hey @ber, generate a sequence diagram for the user authentication flow
in auth.js
```

```{filename=BER}
Generated Sequence Diagram:


graph TD;
    A["Start"] --> B["User Attempts Login"];
    C -->|Yes| D["Generate JWT Token"];
    B --> C{Is User Valid?};
    C -->|No| E["Return Error Message"];
    D --> F["Send Token to Client"];
    F --> G["User Logged In Successfully"];
    E --> H["Log Failed Attempt"];
    H --> A;
    G --> I["End"];

============================
| Format:  | Mermaid      |
| Source:  | auth.js      |
| Scope:   | Auth Flow    |
============================

üëâ To save diagram, comment: @ber approve 9c4f182e
```

```{filename=USER}
@ber approve 9c4f182e
```

```{filename=BER}
‚úÖ Diagram saved to docs/diagrams/auth-flow.svg

Details:
===========================================
| Location: | docs/diagrams/auth-flow.svg |
| Format:   | SVG                         |
| Size:     | 24KB                        |

> BER's flexible workflows enable you to build powerful agents for various use cases:

## User Access Management

> [!TIP]
> This interaction demonstrates automated user provisioning:
> 1. Request to create accounts across multiple services
> 2. BER prepares the changes for approval
> 3. Upon approval, accounts are created with appropriate permissions

```{filename=USER}
hey @ber, create accounts for jane.doe@company.com in our standard
tools stack (Slack, Jira, GitLab) with developer permissions
```

```{filename=BER}
Account Creation Summary

=====================
| Service | Status  |
| ------- | ------- |
| Slack   | Pending |
| Jira    | Pending |
| GitLab  | Pending |
=====================

üëâ To create accounts, comment: @ber approve 7d2e891f
```

```{filename=USER}
@ber approve 7d2e891f
```

```{filename=BER}
‚úÖ Accounts created successfully

Details:
================================
| Service | Status  | Username |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Slack   | Created | jane.doe |
| Jira    | Created | jane.doe |
| GitLab  | Created | jane.doe |
================================

‚ùóÔ∏è To revert, comment: @ber revert 3f8a620d
```

```
hey @ber, show me all active service accounts for
john.smith@company.com who is leaving next week
```

```
hey @ber, revoke all access for departed employee
mark.wilson@company.com and generate an audit report
```




## Custom Reports

> [!TIP]
> This example shows BER's reporting capabilities:
> 1. User requests a signup report with specific parameters
> 2. BER generates a preview of the data
> 3. Upon approval, full report is generated in multiple formats

```{filename=USER}
hey @ber, generate a report of all users who signed up
in the last 30 days, grouped by country
```

```{filename=BER}
Report Preview:

=====================
| Country | Signups |
| ------- | ------- |
| USA     | 1,245   |
| UK      | 892     |
| Germany | 567     |
| Others  | 1,890   |
=====================

üëâ To generate full report, comment: @ber approve 1a2b3c4d
```

```{filename=USER}
@ber approve 1a2b3c4d
```

```{filename=BER}
‚úÖ Report generated and shared

Details:
================================
| Format:    | CSV, PDF        |
| Location:  | reports/        |

## Incident Management

> [!TIP]
> This example demonstrates automated monitoring setup:
> 1. User requests log monitoring for specific errors
> 2. BER configures the monitoring rules
> 3. Upon approval, monitoring is enabled with ServiceNow integration

```{filename=USER}
hey @ber, monitor the logs for ConnectionTimeout errors
and create a ticket in ServiceNow if it appears
```

```{filename=BER}
Monitor Configuration:

=================================
| Type:     | Error Pattern     |
| Pattern:  | ConnectionTimeout |
| Action:   | Create Ticket     |
| System:   | ServiceNow        |
=================================

üëâ To enable monitoring, comment: @ber approve 4d5e6f7g
```

```{filename=USER}
@ber approve 4d5e6f7g
```

```{filename=BER}
‚úÖ Monitor enabled

Details:
===============================
| Status:    | Active         |
| Monitor ID:| MON-2024-123   |
| Logs:      | /var/log/app/* |
| Notify:    | #incidents     |
===============================
