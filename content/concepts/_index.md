The Concepts section helps you learn about the parts of the BER system and the abstractions BER.

## Introduction
### Why we make BER
The collective intelligence represented by the current models is a marvel in its own terms. The partial coherence and understanding can still make it frustrating to use them to complete everyday tasks. This hit-and-miss in their usefulness is a huge waste. We believe this is a topological issue that boils down to data structures.

### How we envision BER
BER aims to be the framework that brings natural language capabilities as useful and purposeful services through human interfaces.

### Who can benefit from BER
BER hopes to accomodate both business users and casual audiences. Here are illustrative examples: Business users may employ BER as product owners, technical writers, IT administrators. Casual audiences, hobbyists, interested hackers can get assistance from BER in technical writing, charts and other types of visualisation.

## BER components
### Agents
An agent component is the highest-level collection of features and data, and it covers a specific knowledge domain. The agents are task-based and follow a simple request-response pattern.

### Adapters
An adapter is a module that brings BER to an interface near you. It is a connection, an interface, an insulation between the environment and the BER agents. Usually an adapter implementation uses a 3rd-party API of a platform. This enables BER to be present on your platforms and allows BER to handle the input and output as well. The adapters are flexible, extendable and simple objects which all have a common base abstraction.
