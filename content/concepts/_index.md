The Concepts section helps you learn about the parts of the BER system and the abstractions BER.

## Introduction
### Why we make BER
The collective intelligence represented by the current models is a marvel in its own terms. The partial coherence and understanding can still make it frustrating to use them to complete everyday tasks. This hit-and-miss in their usefulness is a huge waste. We believe this is a topological issue that boils down to data structures.

### How we envision BER
BER aims to be the framework that brings natural language capabilities as useful and purposeful services through human interfaces.

### Who can benefit from BER
BER hopes to accomodate both business users and casual audiences. Here are illustrative examples: Business users may employ BER as product owners, technical writers, IT administrators. Casual audiences, hobbyists, interested hackers can get assistance from BER in technical writing, charts and other types of visualisation.

## BER components
### Agents
A `BERAgent` is a container of skills covering a specific knowledge domain.

### Adapters
A `BERAdapter` is an interface that maintains communication to an external systems through their APIs.
