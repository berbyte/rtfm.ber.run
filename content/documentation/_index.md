## Summary
The BER framework is constructed in the image of the Actor model. The combination of independent and distributed processing with the power of AI creates capable, guided, modifiable agents who can assist you and execute tasks on your behalf within their operating domain.

The 2 main components are the actors and the communication channel with these actors. In this context we call the actor: `BERAgent` and the channel: `BERAdapter`. The system is composed of multiple independent agents and adapters running in parallel. 

Throughout our documentation you will find an overview of this system, tutorials to get started, and practical examples to compose and customize BER.
