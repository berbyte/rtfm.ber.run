We need to communicate something like this very clearly in the first sentence:

  - BER is the glue between any ITSM/Developer Platform/Chat -> LLM -> 3rd party API
  - BER is a framework to build AI powered IFTT workflows
  - BER helps you interacting with any API using natural language with any interface you want to use


chatgpt's recommendation:
> BER is an open-source framework that connects project management, collaboration, and developer tools ?with LLMs and third-party APIs, enabling AI-powered workflows and natural language interactions with any interface.

BER is a versatile, structured, systematic framework to employ AI models, to deploy autonomous agents in a domain of your interest, and to correspond with them specifically and reliably.

The marriage of free-form data input and structured access that makes for example, spreadsheets so ubiquitous is a useful analogy to understand how BER works.

BER consists of domain expert `Agents` composed of `Skills`, `Actions`, `Validators` just like a real-world colleague.

 - **Natural language input** Whatever the medium and the task at hand you can say so without needing to think about `syntax`
 - **Control over AI models** Use the combination of `agents`, `skills`, `validation`, `action`, and `hook` execution to guide and channel the limitless raw power of LLM-type AI models
 - **Assistance across domains** Customise any of the components to extend BER and encapsulate new fields of expertise and fine-tune various skills to generate, replicate, compare, extract, transform your input
 - **Define the world of BER** Add existing or create new adapters to make BER available on any channel in every medium. Integrate third-party API's for BER to convert their assistance into real-world actions.
