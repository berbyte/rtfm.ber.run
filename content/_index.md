#### Welcome to the BER framework docs
###### What is BER?
BER is a versatile, structured, systematic framework to employ AI models, to deploy autonomous agents in a domain of your interest, and to correspond with them specifically and reliably. The marriage of free-form data input and structured access that makes for example, spreadsheets so ubiquitous is a useful analogy to understand how BER works. BER consists of domain expert Agents composed of skills, actions, validations just like a real-world colleague. For example, a product owner agent can assist you in giving estimates, breaking down a task into requirements.

###### Features
 - **Natural language input** Whatever the medium and the task at hand you can say so without needing to think about `syntax`
 - **Control over AI models** Use the combination of agents, skills, validation, action, and hook execution to guide and channel the limitless raw power of LLM-type AI models
 - **Assistance across domains** Customise any of the components to extend BER and encapsulate new fields of expertise and fine-tune various skills to generate, replicate, compare, extract, transform your input
 - **Define the world of BER** Add existing or create new adapters to make BER available on any channel in every medium. Integrate third-party API's for BER to convert their assistance into real-world actions.

#### (Further) Introduction for first time visitors
###### Why we make BER
The collective intelligence represented by the current models is a marvel in its own terms. The partial coherence and understanding can still make it frustrating to use them to complete everyday tasks. This hit-and-miss in their usefulness is a huge waste. We believe this is a topological issue that boils down to data structures.

###### How we envision BER
BER aims to be the framework that brings natural language capabilities as useful and purposeful services through human interfaces.

##### Who can benefit from BER
BER hopes to accomodate both business users and casual audiences. Here are illustrative examples: Business users may employ BER as product owners, technical writers, IT administrators. Casual audiences, hobbyists, interested hackers can get assistance from BER in technical writing, charts and other types of visualisation.
