BER is a knowledge framework to build your own AI-powered IFTT workflows. With the help of BER you can create custom-tailored knowledge domains, to connect them with any interface you want to use, to collaborate with any (3rd party) API's in natural language.

Cut context-switching and bureaucratic overhead by using BER agents and BER adapters. Bring Your Own BER!

## Overview
BER is a versatile, structured, systematic framework to employ AI models, to deploy autonomous agents in a domain of your interest, and to correspond with them specifically and reliably through interface adapters.

The marriage of free-form data input and structured access to output makes it a great glue between systems which could not have been combined with traditional methods.

BER consists of domain expert [`Agents`](/content/concepts/agent) composed of `Skills`, `Actions`, `Validators` just like a real-world colleague. It communicates on channels defined in its [`Adapters`](/content/concepts/adapter) with 3rd party APIs, platforms, cloud services or any external system.
