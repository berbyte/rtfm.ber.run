## Overview
`BER` is a structured framework to employ AI models, to deploy autonomous agents in a domain of your interest, and to correspond with them specifically and reliably through interface adapters.

`BER` consists of multiple domain-expert [`Agents`](/concepts/agent) just like a real-world team. It communicates on channels defined in its [`Adapters`](/concepts/adapter) with any external system.
