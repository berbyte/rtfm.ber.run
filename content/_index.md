BER is the superglue between your collaboration tools and the APIs, cloud providers, and databases you need to manage.

Powered by an LLM, it understands natural language commands, translates them into executable actions, and runs them with your approval—automating workflows, reducing manual effort, and keeping everything in sync.

Cut context-switching and bureaucratic overhead.

## Overview
Use `BER` to access skilled agents that assist you with your work. Keep talking in natural language on the most common work platforms and receive relevant answers reliably with `BER`'s built-in LLM control structures.

`BER` takes the form of a commandable, AI-powered bot with the handle `@ber`. On any platform you install it, you will have access to that context for all your workflows, and all workflows can be used from one context.

`BER` as a software system consists of multiple domain-expert [`Agents`](/concepts/agent) with different skills, content validators, reacting to hooks with actions, just like a real-world team. Agents have a basic structure that allows users to build their own agents in their custom knowledge domain.

You can communicate on channels defined in its [`Adapters`](/concepts/adapter) with any external system. You can already install `BER` as an application for GitHub. Adapters are pluggable to make it easy to integrate a `@ber`bot with your own workplace API.

The site shows the [`Concepts`](/concepts) for understanding more, offers a [Getting Started guide](/getting-started), teaches how to use `BER` in [`Tutorials`](/tutorials).
